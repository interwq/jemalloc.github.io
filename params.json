  "body": "jemalloc is a general purpose malloc(3) implementation that emphasizes\r\nfragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support.  jemalloc first came\r\ninto use as the FreeBSD libc allocator in 2005, and since then it has found its\r\nway into numerous applications that rely on its predictable behavior.  In 2010\r\njemalloc development efforts broadened to include developer support features\r\nsuch as heap profiling and extensive monitoring/tuning hooks.  Modern jemalloc\r\nreleases continue to be integrated back into FreeBSD, and therefore versatility\r\nremains critical.  Ongoing development efforts trend toward making jemalloc\r\namong the best allocators for a broad range of demanding applications, and\r\neliminating/mitigating weaknesses that have practical repercussions for real\r\nworld applications.\r\n\r\nStarting points:\r\n- The ```COPYING``` file contains copyright and licensing information.\r\n- The ```INSTALL``` file contains information on how to configure, build, and\r\n  install jemalloc.\r\n- The ```ChangeLog``` file contains a brief summary of changes for each release.\r\n- The [wiki](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki) contains miscellaneous\r\ndocumentation such as links to papers and presentations, FAQ answers, and\r\ntutorials.\r\n\r\nTo stay abreast of release activity, track the [releases atom\r\nfeed](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/releases.atom).  To monitor or\r\nparticipate in development,\r\n[watch](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/subscription) the primary\r\n[jemalloc repository](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc).\r\n\r\nURL: https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc\r\n",
