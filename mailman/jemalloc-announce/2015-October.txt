Subject: jemalloc 4.0.4 released
Message-ID: <3DDC6D7F-21F5-4136-AA43-14A36264A65E@canonware.com>

jemalloc 4.0.4 is now available.  This bugfix release fixes another xallocx() regression. No other regressions have come to light in over a month, so this is likely a good starting point for people who prefer to wait for "dot one" releases with all the major issues shaken out.

Bug fixes:
- Fix xallocx(..., MALLOCX_ZERO to zero the last full trailing page of large allocations that have been randomly assigned an offset of 0 when --enable-cache-oblivious configure option is enabled.
