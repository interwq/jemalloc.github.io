Subject: jemalloc 2.2.3 released
Message-ID: <4E5FEDBA.6080606@canonware.com>

jemalloc 2.2.3 is now available.  This version fixes numerous bugs 
related to heap profiling.

   Bug fixes:
   - Fix a prof-related race condition.  This bug could cause memory
     corruption, but only occurred in non-default configurations
     (prof_accum:false).
   - Fix off-by-one backtracing issues (make sure that prof_alloc_prep()
     is excluded from backtraces).
   - Fix a prof-related bug in realloc() (only triggered by OOM errors).
   - Fix prof-related bugs in allocm() and rallocm().
   - Fix prof_tdata_cleanup() for --disable-tls builds.
   - Fix a relative include path, to fix objdir builds.
