Subject: jemalloc 3.4.0 released
Message-ID: <AA95F861-0D9C-482B-81D5-0EC48C56E1FC@canonware.com>

jemalloc 3.4.0 is now available.  This version is essentially a small bugfix release, but the addition of aarch64 support requires that the minor version be incremented.

Bug fixes:
- Fix race-triggered deadlocks in chunk_record().  These deadlocks were typically triggered by multiple threads concurrently deallocating huge objects.

New features:
- Add support for the aarch64 architecture.
