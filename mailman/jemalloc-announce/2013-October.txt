Subject: Master git repository moved
Message-ID: <A306C40D-7D9E-4B70-8F80-981E469A1554@canonware.com>

The master git repository for jemalloc is now on GitHub:

The primary intention behind this move is to streamline contribution/integration of patches.  Other benefits are likely to surface over time.

Subject: jemalloc 3.4.1 released
Message-ID: <75EE080D-3DE3-4791-A2BD-3429012BC50F@canonware.com>

jemalloc 3.4.1 is now available.  This version fixes a serious bug in the "arenas.extend" mallctl, as well as several minor issues.

Bug fixes:
- Fix a race in the "arenas.extend" mallctl that could cause memory corruption of internal data structures and subsequent crashes.
- Fix Valgrind integration flaws that caused Valgrind warnings about reads of uninitialized memory in:
  + arena chunk headers
  + internal zero-initialized data structures (relevant to tcache and prof code)
- Preserve errno during the first allocation.  A readlink(2) call during initialization fails unless /etc/malloc.conf exists, so errno was typically set during the first allocation prior to this fix.
- Fix compilation warnings reported by gcc 4.8.1.
