Subject: jemalloc 4.1.1 released
Message-ID: <46439D75-8BD8-4CFD-97EC-668ED6A8D7D0@canonware.com>

jemalloc 4.1.1 is now available.  This bugfix release resolves a variety of mostly minor issues, though the bitmap fix is critical for 64-bit Windows.

Bug fixes:
- Fix the linear scan version of bitmap_sfu() to shift by the proper amount even when sizeof(long) is not the same as sizeof(void *), as on 64-bit Windows. (@jasone)
- Fix hashing functions to avoid unaligned memory accesses (and resulting crashes). This is relevant at least to some ARM-based platforms. (@rkmisra)
- Fix fork()-related lock rank ordering reversals. These reversals were unlikely to cause deadlocks in practice except when heap profiling was enabled and active. (@jasone)
- Fix various chunk leaks in OOM code paths. (@jasone)
- Fix malloc_stats_print() to print opt.narenas correctly. (@jasone)
- Fix MSVC-specific build/test issues. (@rustyx, @yuslepukhin)
- Fix a variety of test failures that were due to test fragility rather than core bugs. (@jasone)

Subject: jemalloc 4.2.0 released
Message-ID: <46FACF10-C946-4ABC-A6EB-A8A653776BE8@canonware.com>

jemalloc 4.2.0 is now available.

New features:
- Add the arena.<i>.reset mallctl, which makes it possible to discard all of an arena's allocations in a single operation. (@jasone)
- Add the stats.retained and stats.arenas.<i>.retained statistics. (@jasone)
- Add the --with-version configure option. (@jasone)
- Support --with-lg-page values larger than actual page size. (@jasone)

Optimizations:
- Use pairing heaps rather than red-black trees for various hot data structures. (@djwatson, @jasone)
- Streamline fast paths of rtree operations. (@jasone)
- Optimize the fast paths of calloc() and [m,d,sd]allocx(). (@jasone)
- Decommit unused virtual memory if the OS does not overcommit. (@jasone)
- Specify MAP_NORESERVE on Linux if [heuristic] overcommit is active, in order to avoid unfortunate interactions during fork(2). (@jasone)

Bug fixes:
- Fix chunk accounting related to triggering gdump profiles. (@jasone)
- Link against librt for clock_gettime(2) if glibc < 2.17. (@jasone)
- Scale leak report summary according to sampling probability. (@jasone)
