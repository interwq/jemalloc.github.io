<PRE>Hi,

We are currently using TCMalloc as our memory allocator, however the significantly better fragmentation characteristics and deterministic lowest-available address selection of jemalloc means we want switching to jemalloc in the near future.

One of (the only?) sticking points however is the lack of a direct equivalent to TCMalloc&#8217;s new/delete hooks, which allow an application to register callbacks when memory is allocated/freed by the application. 

We use this feature to essentially perform sub-heap memory tracking, to determine how much memory different buckets (think tables/databases) are using. To be more specific, as a worker thread is assigned to a particular bucket the bucket ID is stored in TLS, and then when a new/delete callback is invoked we lookup the thread&#8217;s current bucket from TLS and increment/decrement the total used as appropriate.

To allow us to work with jemalloc, I&#8217;ve implemented[1] equivalent functionality in jemalloc.

I did consider making use of the arena functionality in jemalloc for this, but I was concerned about the potential increase in fragment ion with many arenas, which is exactly one of the reasons why we want to move away from TCMalloc (I&#8217;m proposing setting narenas=1 when we deploy).

How would you (Jason?) feel about merging this patch, or something conceptually similar into upstream? 


Thanks,

Dave Rigby
