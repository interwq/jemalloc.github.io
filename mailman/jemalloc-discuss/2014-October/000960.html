</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are currently using TCMalloc as our memory allocator, however the significantly better fragmentation characteristics and deterministic lowest-available address selection of jemalloc means we want switching to jemalloc in the near future.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of (the only?) sticking points however is the lack of a direct equivalent to TCMalloc&#8217;s new/delete hooks, which allow an application to register callbacks when memory is allocated/freed by the application. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We use this feature to essentially perform sub-heap memory tracking, to determine how much memory different buckets (think tables/databases) are using. To be more specific, as a worker thread is assigned to a particular bucket the bucket ID is stored in TLS, and then when a new/delete callback is invoked we lookup the thread&#8217;s current bucket from TLS and increment/decrement the total used as appropriate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To allow us to work with jemalloc, I&#8217;ve implemented[1] equivalent functionality in jemalloc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did consider making use of the arena functionality in jemalloc for this, but I was concerned about the potential increase in fragment ion with many arenas, which is exactly one of the reasons why we want to move away from TCMalloc (I&#8217;m proposing setting narenas=1 when we deploy).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How would you (Jason?) feel about merging this patch, or something conceptually similar into upstream?

</I>&gt;<i> I have some concerns about this functionality that have kept me from adding it so far:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - It adds yet another branch to the fast path, whereas if you create your own wrappers and mangle jemalloc's API, it imposes no cost on applications which don't need hooks.
</I>&gt;<i> - It's really tricky (and requires a messy API) to support hooks that get called for all allocations from the beginning of program execution.  I don't know of a way to pull this off short of exposing weak function pointer symbols that can be overridden during static linking or dynamic loading.
</I>&gt;<i> - It can result in really surprising &quot;impossible&quot; behavior if the compiler makes assumptions about globally visible side effects, as does gcc.  In order to make hooks generally safe, the application must be compiled with -fno-builtin-malloc -fno-builtin-calloc -fno-builtin-realloc -fno-builtin-free.  Other compilers potentially have similar issues, possibly without escape hatches.  I worry that hooks add a documentation burden on jemalloc, and that people will repeatedly fail to take note of this requirement, leaving them with the impression that jemalloc is somehow flakey.
</I>&gt;<i>

Thanks for the detailed comments - I appreciate the concerns from the jemalloc side of things on adding such a feature.

One complication from my side (which admittedly isn&#8217;t directly related to jemalloc) is that I need to support OS X, Windows and Linux. With TCMalloc this is straightforward: I simply link it in and take advantage of (a) it&#8217;s automatic malloc replacement on every platform (runtime patching, OS X zone replacement or ELF symbol prescience) and (b) callbacks on new/delete.

To deploy jemalloc things get much more complex:

a) No malloc replacement on Windows
b) No callbacks on new/delete

I&#8217;m still investigating the best way to solve (a) - I don&#8217;t really fancy porting all the C++ runtime patching code to C/jemalloc but if we want to use jemalloc on Windows this might be the best solution.

For (b) if I don&#8217;t add callbacks to jemalloc and instead write my own wrappers, I then need to ensure these are used - trivial on Linux, but on OS X I&#8217;ll need to clone a bunch of the zone code from jemalloc to add my own zone with the wrapper functions.

I&#8217;ll probably go down the wrapper route, but if nothing else this does highlight some integration pain-points which jemalloc has compared to TCmalloc, particularly if people are migrating from TCmalloc to jemalloc.


Thanks,

Dave Rigby
