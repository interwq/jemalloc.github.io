</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is this behavior expected? Shouldn&#8217;t jemalloc use a fresh arena for each new thread?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When jemalloc assigns an arena to a thread, it finds the set of default (non-&quot;extend&quot;) arenas that have the fewest assigned threads, and assigns the lowest-numbered arena in that set to the thread.  If you were to remove the &quot;thread.arena&quot; assignment from your test program (which is consistent with your stated purpose), you would end up with your threads assigned to arenas 0 and 1, and you would additionally have two arenas that jemalloc uses only if you specify MALLOCX_ARENA() to one of the *allocx() functions.  As it is, the test program is racey; you could end up with the created thread initially assigned to arena 1, if a context switch happened at the right time.
</I>
I can&#8217;t use the default arenas because I&#8217;m using a custom chunk allocator and I couldn't figure out a way to get jemalloc to release all of the chunks associated with an arena after setting the chunk allocator&#8212;I don&#8217;t even know what&#8217;s been allocated prior to that so I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s even feasible. I&#8217;d have to shift them to a different arena or something, and that seems like a lot of work.

I need fast concurrent access to the arenas managing my network-registered address space, so I&#8217;m extending the arena space, binding the chunk allocator, and then swapping to it. I wanted to use the existing arena for slower access to mostly-private, system mmap()ed data, and I don&#8217;t want these arenas shared since I&#8217;m bypassing the cache when using them.

I am working around my issue by using two extended arenas for each thread, one for the private allocations and one for the shared registered memory regions, and just leaving the &#8220;primordial&#8221; arenas to rot, which sees fine since arenas have such low overhead.

As you might imagine, I&#8217;m running into an issue where dallocx with MALLOCX_ARENA() set is caching allocations when I don&#8217;t want them to be cached. I have to embed and distribute a slightly modified jemalloc where I comment out the optimistic caching in dallocx and rallocx. A different BYPASS_CACHE flag would be useful here, but it&#8217;s not an urgent issue.

Thanks for your help. It&#8217;s a huge help to us.
