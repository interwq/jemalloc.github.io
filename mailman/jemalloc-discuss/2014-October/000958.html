I've given some thought to something similar to the latter: each thread invisibly has a cache layered on top of any arena which is explicitly used for allocation.  I'm still in the idea phase on this, so I'm really interested to hear any insights you have.

I want to be able to allocate and free from address spaces independently (with the extended interface), and have caching work. There may be more than one arena per address space, in fact, I&#8217;d guess that each thread would have at least one arena for each address space. Having to bypass the cache right now is bad for us because we start to thrash the allocator with allocx/dallocx from different places, so I&#8217;d like to be able to cache based on address space.

Thanks Jason,

This seems to be a good representation of the issue. Creating a thread cache, and explicitly associating an arena with it that has a custom chunk allocator would solve our problem. I would then be able to manage our network address space as an independent entity by providing a network arena and cache to each thread, and then explicitly using it for network allocation without having to sacrifice scalable performance for normal allocations, or vice versa.

This would eliminate lots of hacks that I have going at the moment.
