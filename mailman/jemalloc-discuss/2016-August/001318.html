<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Hi all. &#160;I wonder if anyone has any thoughts for me about a situation I
have.

I'm working on GNU/Linux.

I'm compiling jemalloc as a static library (with -fPIC) then I link it
into my own shared library (.so). &#160;I use -fvisibility=hidden so that
the jemalloc symbols are not visible outside the shared library (e.g.,
when I use &quot;nm&quot; on my .so, all the jemalloc symbols are marked &quot;t&quot; not
&quot;T&quot;).

It works all the time for my testing and most of the time for my users.
However, in some situations I've had users report that their process is
hanging and when I get a stacktrace, the hang is happening inside
pthread_mutex_unlock called from within jemalloc tls stuff. &#160;Note that
my library is not being linked directly, it's being dlopen()'d, so the
process is running for a bit before my library is loaded. &#160;To be
precise, it's being loaded inside an openjdk 1.8 JVM and invoked from
Java using JNI.

Here's a sample stacktrace:

#0&#160;&#160;0x0000003793a0a8a9 in pthread_mutex_unlock () from ./lib64/libpthread.so.0
#1&#160;&#160;0x00000037932110d2 in tls_get_addr_tail () from ./lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
#2&#160;&#160;0x0000003793211500 in __tls_get_addr () from ./lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

#9&#160;&#160;0x00007f0181a5f7dd in prof_tdata_get () at jemalloc/include/jemalloc/internal/prof.h:317

&#160; ...

(I should come clean and mention this is an older version of jemalloc:
3.1 I believe--if that's likely to be the issue I can look into
updating).

The hang seems to happen very close to when this library starts, and
it's clearly in a fundamental area.

What I was wondering was whether it might be possible that some static
memory inside jemalloc was not getting initialized in the right order
when the shared library is loaded. &#160;Perhaps there's some other static
variable with a constructor which allocates memory, and if they are
invoked in the wrong order then jemalloc's structures are not set up
properly or something.

Does this seem like it might be plausible? &#160;If so is there anything
that can be done (other than sweeping all my code to remove any
allocation done during a static constructor)? &#160;It's OK if this is a
GCC-only solution, such as using __attribute__((init_priority())) or
something...

It would be much simpler if I could reproduce the problem myself, then
I could just experiment, but so far no luck.
