Subject: how to remove pthread mutex dependency in jemalloc
Message-ID: <1347557014.57854.YahooMailNeo@web122205.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have a system that have no thread, and usage of the jemalloc are per process only.? I don't see anything in the library that I could turn off the usage of pthread mutex easily without heavily modified the library which I am afraid I may break something along the way.

Would you point me to the direction of safely remove any dependency on pthread and mutex in the code?

Thanks
?

I don't think jemalloc is designed for this situation.  Indeed, much
of the complexity in jemalloc is around making it fast in a threaded
environment.

It sounds like jemalloc may be the wrong tool for you to use.

?Actually, jemalloc is the best I could find for my application, the 
glibc default one give me lots of holes during the long running of my 
application no matter how I tweak the parameters for the memory 
allocator and jemalloc fits there nicely.? I am in the process of 
stripping down the library but if the library itself could give some 
flags to help out will be better.

Subject: mark _pthread_mutex_init_calloc_cb as public explicitly
Message-ID: <1TDx6L-000Als-9z@internal.tormail.org>

Mozilla build hides everything by default using visibility pragma and
unhides only explicitly listed headers. But this doesn't work on FreeBSD
because _pthread_mutex_init_calloc_cb is neither documented nor exposed
via any header.

Subject: jemalloc and STL
Message-ID: <CACSmO4Z0apatOM3D36L07KGEQ=YcNDEKXU6HsJkYUsVMgW-aXw@mail.gmail.com>

Is it sufficient to link in jemalloc at compile time (i.e. -ljemalloc)
if I want it to be used by STL containers?  Or do I need to specify
the allocator, as in:
typedef std::list<int, malloc_alloc> mylist;

Forgive me if this was already answered in the documentation.  I could
not find it.
