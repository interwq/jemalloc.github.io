OS X's MADV_FREE behavior is great from a total system perspective.  jemalloc suffers nontrivial overhead on Linux because all MADV_DONTNEED'ed pages have to be zeroed before they are handed out again.  At Facebook we've considered numerous approaches to the problem, and tried a few of them, but I'd be thrilled to have MADV_DONTNEED on Linux.

I don't think there is a system-supplied way to introspect the number of pages with the MADV_FREE'd bit set.  If all you really care about is memory accounting, then note that starting with jemalloc 1.0.0, there are statistics counters that tell you roughly what you want to know.  In particular, take a look at the &quot;stats.allocated&quot;, &quot;stats.active&quot;, and &quot;stats.mapped&quot; statistics that are accessible via mallctl().  These and many other statistics are documented in the manual page:

	<A HREF="http://www.canonware.com/download/jemalloc/jemalloc-latest/doc/jemalloc.html">http://www.canonware.com/download/jemalloc/jemalloc-latest/doc/jemalloc.html</A>

Internally, jemalloc knows precisely how many unused dirty pages could be MADV_FREE'd (see &quot;stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.pdirty&quot;), but once madvise(2) is called for a page, the application has no way of knowing whether the kernel actually reclaimed the page.  As such, you can monitor &quot;stats.active&quot; and have a pretty good idea of how much memory your application is using without counting the MADV_FREE'd pages.  You can also sum the &quot;stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.pdirty&quot; stats, but this isn't really necessary unless you want to be very precise, because unused dirty page accumulation is limited to be no more than 1/32 of active memory (by default).
