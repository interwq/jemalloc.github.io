I want the sum of malloc_usable_size() for all extant allocations to remain the source of truth about how much memory the application has allocated, and I'm currently on a mission to make size class spacing uniform, so I'm loath to add exceptions before even finishing that.  If 1.2X worst case is too loose a bound for your use case, one other possibility would be to add a configure option to create 8 size classes per size doubling rather than 4, so that the worst case is ~1.11X (or 16 size classes per doubling and 1.06X worst case overhead, etc.).  The size_classes.sh script requires only a single constant be parametrized in order to make this possible.

Thanks,
Jason
