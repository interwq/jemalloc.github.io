Subject: Is the swap feature useful?
Message-ID: <4F14E528.8080007@canonware.com>

Over the two years that jemalloc has had the swap feature (optionally 
compiled in if --enable-swap is specified to configure), I've received 
many general questions about the feature, but I have yet to hear of a 
single person actually using it in an application.  As such I'm 
considering removing the feature in jemalloc 3.0.0.  Does anyone find 
the feature sufficiently useful to warrant its continued existence?

Thanks,
Jason

Subject: realloc behavior
Message-ID: <4F2575EB.7020700@hola.org>

Hi,

I just started using jemalloc, and one of our tests fail, because 
realloc with size=0
does malloc with size 1.

from realloc spec at 
http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/functions/realloc.html :
If/size/is 0 and/ptr/is not a null pointer, the object pointed to is freed.


Why does jemalloc chooses to behave differently?


Yoni.

Subject: jemalloc win32 port
Message-ID: <4F27C183.3020201@hola.org>

Hi,

I am working with Firefox version of jemalloc (x86 and x64), And it is 
working as expected.
But, I wanted to use the original version of jemalloc, mainly because 
there are profiling features missing
in Firefox's version, and because I wanted to be able to get bug fixes 
and new features from TRUNK.
So, I Ported jemalloc to win32 (using msvc10 on win7 x86)
I did not completed all the work (yet), but i have a working version.
These are the changes I made (patch attached):

  * prn.h - apparently it is not possible to create a file named prn.xxx
    on windows. I changed the name of the file to _prn.h
  * atomic.h - added win32 intrinsic implementation
  * compat_win32.h - all sort of definitions needed for win32 (most of
    them from Firefox version + pthread handling - not completed yet)
  * compat_win32.c - need to complete here win32_setspecific and
    win32_setspecific by using ".CRT$XXX"
  * arena.c, ctl.h, ctl.c, ckh.c - C99 compatibility
  * hunk_mmap.c
  * jemalloc_defs.h, jemalloc.h, jemalloc_internal.h - I don't have
    configure, so I copied jemalloc_internal.h.in and hand edited it.
  * mutex.h - win32 mutex (from Firefox version)
  * chunk_mmap.c -pages_map/pages_unmap from Firefox version
  * jemalloc.c - system settings (ncpus etc) + added _crtheap
  * jemalloc.c - win32 crt specific functions (msize, calloc_impl,
    _recalloc, get_heap_handle...)

since jemalloc does not patch malloc and friends, I need to use a 
striped version of msvcrt (removed malloc/free etc).
I have a scripts to do this.

I hope that after the work is done, you can commit this patch to the git.
Any comments/suggestions/help are welcome

Yoni.
