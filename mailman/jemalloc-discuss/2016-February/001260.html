I'll try not to sit on this issue indefinitely, but it takes a while to get my head wrapped around the chunk hooks, so it may be a while before I have time to dig into it.  So much to do...

&gt;<i> It&#8217;s deadlocking right now as well, as I am accessing stats from within the chunk hooks to determine which arenas to purge. I had to replace the malloc mutexes with recursive mutexes to make it work. Seems fine so far.
</I>
My memory is now fuzzy on this aspect of chunk hooks, but my vague recollection is that I attempted to drop all locks before calling into application-provided hook functions, mainly to avoid resource starvation in case the hook functions block in system calls.  Maybe that's not generally possible, or maybe there's just a bug somewhere.  In any case, if allocation is triggered by a call into mallctl(), calling back into mallctl() inside the hooks is going to deadlock, so calling back into jemalloc APIs is not generally safe.

&gt;<i> Basically, I am running with lots of main memory (&gt; 1TB). Most of the time the program will only use a fraction of the available memory but some queries will require almost all the memory in some random arena. So even if I leave purging on and set lg_dirty_mult to say 3, some arenas might end up having cached 10s of GB of physical memory with others running out and the program will crash. Ideally, I would want BSD&#8217;s MADV_FREE on Linux. That patch never got merged though. So what I am doing is to add some logic that tracks the amount of committed physical memory and if some threshold is reached, I query the jemalloc stats and dynamically adjust the purging ratio. Does that make sense?
</I>
Yes, dynamically updating the purging ratio is a reasonable approach, and I've done something similar in HHVM (temporarily purge more aggressively if any request threads go idle).

By the way, the MADV_FREE will apparently be in the next Linux kernel release.

Keep an eye on <A HREF="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/149,">https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/149,</A> which I'm actively working on.  So far it looks like I'm going to be able to implement a time-based purging mechanism that does a much better job of controlling unused dirty pages *without* asynchronous purging threads, as long as the application doesn't go completely idle.  I'm planning to get this feature into the 4.1.0 release as an opt-in, and I suspect it's going to prevail as the default mechanism in a subsequent release.
