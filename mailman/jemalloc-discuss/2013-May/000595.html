<PRE>Just wanted to mention that I printed out the addresses being returned 
from jemalloc() and those addresses fit within the range of the smaps in 
question.  So I'm certain the smaps with large Private_Clean bytes belongs 
to jemalloc.

Questions:

1) Why does jemalloc have smaps with such large Private_Clean size?  I'm 
actually surprised jemalloc has such large smaps in general.  I would 
expect a bunch of smaller smaps that match the configured chunk size.

2) Will the Linux kernel ever reclaim private clean pages, or at least 
move them out of physical memory?  Eventually we see RSS for several of 
our processes (that use jemalloc) grow beyond what's expected and the OOM 
killer in the kernel takes out our process(es).

3) Are there any configurations that can be done to influence the handling 
of private clean pages?  Either jemalloc or Linux tuning.

        thx again !

Subject:
High amount of private clean data in smaps


We have a java application which has a native component written in C, that 
makes use of JNI to manage several of our objects that we directly 
allocate via jemalloc.  One of the goals for our C code is to not allow 
our processes RSS size to grow beyond a certain point.  To do this our app 
monitors jemallocs stats.cactive, when it sees that cactive reach a 
certain point we write certain some of our objects to disk then we free 
the allocated memory.  In this case, the objects that we are freeing are 
4K and above, so when we free the pages holding these objects should no 
longer be active.  That part seems to be working.

After several hours of running our application at full load, we start to 
see our RSS go beyond what is expected.  This unexpected growth seems to 
happen faster for some instances of our application vs others.  I compared 
the /proc smaps file between instances of our app that had a high RSS to 
those with expected RSS.  In both cases smap shows a really large map that 
I think belongs to jemalloc.  I believe it belongs to jemalloc, because if 
it didn't the sum of jemallocs active size + the RSS size of this map goes 
well beyond our processes overall RSS size. 

The thing that is really strange about this mmap is that it's 
Private_Clean sizes is really high, e.g. 1.4 GBs.  I don't know much about 
private clean pages, other than what a few google searchs told me about 
them being pages that have not been modified since they were mapped.  I'm 
hopeful that you can tell me more about private clean pages and if/why 
jemalloc would have maps with such high private clean pages.

Here's one such map from my smaps file and the jemalloc stats around the 
same time.  At this time /proc status showed our VmRSS size was 10440804
