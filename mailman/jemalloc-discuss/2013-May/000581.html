While the resident memory stays low and it is not a problem as such, when we try to fork a process from within here, it fails as the kernel assumes there is not enough memory to copy the VM space. Perhaps a vfork would be better but we can't use that for now.

Non huge memory allocations and freeing up remain the same. This seems to help us. I have attached the patch here which is against jemalloc-3.3.1. Please review and suggest if there is a better way to handle this.

Does --enable-munmap give you similar results?  Ideally, munmap() would always be enabled, but Linux has some unfortunate VM map fragmentation issues (it doesn't consistently reuse holes left by munmap()).  I don't think there's much benefit to using munmap() only selectively, because avoiding the VM map fragmentation issue is an all-or-nothing proposition.

At times I've considered adding pre-fork() code that unmaps everything possible, and purges unused dirty pages.  The problem with this is that it's expensive, and it doesn't pay off if the process does exec() right after fork() -- the common case.
