jemalloc takes advantage of constant-time address masking operations to 
find metadata associated with allocated objects, so although it mostly 
segregates metadata and data, completely abstracting the two away from 
each other would take quite a bit of refactoring, not to mention that it 
would probably slow down the allocator.  Backing up a bit, I'm trying to 
imagine an allocator with this constraint, and it's immediately clear 
that some standard features, like zero-filled memory via calloc(), would 
not be possible.  What do you need such strong separation for?

&gt;<i> 2)The second requirement is focused on multi-node NUMA systems.

</I>&gt;<i> This behavior is true for any allocator; libc malloc(3), etc.
</I>
If you disable thread caches in jemalloc, and you're careful about your 
thread--&gt;arena associations, you will be able to avoid the problem. 
That is, memory is freed back to the arena from which it came, so as 
long as each arena is only ever used for allocation on a single node 
(and the allocated pages are touched before objects are passed to other 
threads), all of that arena's memory will be locally attached.

As an aside, I'm planning to experiment with using sched_getcpu(3) on 
Linux to choose the arena to allocate from.  Right now there are 4*ncpus 
arenas by default, and threads are uniformly distributed among the 
arenas in order to reduce lock contention.  With sched_getcpu(3) we 
should be able to effectively use only 1*ncpus arenas.  Furthermore, the 
application won't have to mess around with thread--&gt;arena associations; 
instead it can set thread--&gt;CPU affinity as desired, and jemalloc will 
automatically work well.

Cheers,
Jason
