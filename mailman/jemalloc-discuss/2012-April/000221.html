So essentially, what we are currently tracking as committed, which
doesn't include metadata, would be
stats.active + stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.pdirty for each arena

I'm starting to think it would be convenient to have special variables
that return the sum of the corresponding variables for all arenas.
Something like stats.arenas.pdirty that would be the sum of all
stats.arenas.&lt;i&gt;.pdirty.

Another thing we do in that committed number is that we only count pages
for huge allocations instead of complete chunks. If you allocate
chunk_size + a few pages, stats.active will count 2 * chunk_size, while
what we are after is chunk_size + a few pages. As I'm considering
pushing this upstream, I would like to know whether you'd rather this be
done in stats.active, or a separate variable.
