With a more complete tsd testcase than the one I sent yesterday, I can
see how the initialized variable is necessary. However, there's a bug,
because it's not set to false when creating the wrapper, and this makes
the cleanup function called even when tsd_set was never called.

There's also a corner case, with *something_tsd_get() = value. It
doesn't trigger a cleanup at thread shutdown, and I'm not sure if that's
a desired effect. Arguably, maybe this should be forbidden. Adding
const to tsd_get() ensures that, but as a matter of fact,
thread_allocated tsd does this kind of assignment. But it also doesn't
have a cleanup function, so it's not really a problem. We may want to
avoid such things from happening in the future, though.

I'm going to attach my patch queue modifying different TSD
implementation details, and for good measure (and because the ordering
of my last patch was not obvious), I'm also going to push the whole
queue again, with proper ordering.

Please note that patch 6/11 (Add a test for the TSD system) does *not*
build without --enable-debug because it's such impossible build
independent parts of jemalloc with optimized builds. You may however
want to run the test on the freebsd implementation of the TSD system,
because that's the only one I couldn't test. With patches 8 and 9, the
--disable-tls implementation passes the test.

This patch queue closes on Mingw support. Next will be MSVC.

Mike
