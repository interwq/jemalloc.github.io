I must be missing something, because I still don't see how initialized
is any useful. When a thread is created, the specific data value
associated with the key is null and the destructor/cleanup is not
called. Until a value is actually set with setspecific.

Also, come to think of it, I don't even see how that static business
works: while the wrapper data is allocated on heap, the actual type data
is allocated statically, and that will be shared across threads. So in
practice, this means all threads are going to share the same data, and
cross-overwrite it.
