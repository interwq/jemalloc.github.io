No; in fact, in one run of the browser that I recorded, 1 and 2KiB
allocations together use 52% the memory devoted to small allocations
while accounting for only 35% of waste.  So that sounds pretty good!

On the other hand, it still doesn't tell me how to fix things, except
by saying that there's nothing to be fixed.  :)

&gt;<i> Yes, there are some systems that use 64 KiB pages by default, so any solutions need to be pretty pagesize-agnostic.
</I>
I guess supporting &quot;medium&quot; allocations of size pagesize/2 and
pagesize/4 would be feasible.

&gt;<i> Today has been a bunch of interleaved fire drills for me, so I'd better send this email before it gets lost forever. &#160;I'm interested to hear your thoughts on the design space. &#160;It's tempting to do an experiment that removes run headers, but the back-of-the-envelope calculations I did earlier weren't encouraging&#8230;
</I>
Yes, I suspect that for smaller allocations -- particularly when the
size of the allocation is not much larger than the size of the header
-- there isn't much to be gained by this approach.

It sounds like this might be worth digging into more.  I'll let you
know what I come up with.
