Any recursive call into malloc during early jemalloc bootstrapping will cause catastrophic failure.  This is unfortunately a common theme in jemalloc bootstrapping that requires OS-specific solutions.  OS X also calls malloc during TLS initialization, but TSD is very fast on OS X, so it's a reasonable alternative.  The fact that __emutls_get_address() (part of libgcc) is being called in this case makes me wonder if TLS is really an improvement over TSD.  In any case, the only expected adverse effect of disabling TLS is performance-related, and that is an OS-specific effect.  If you are concerned about a performance hit, you can use --with-jemalloc-prefix to change the allocation function names and write a microbenchmark that compares with/without TLS support built in.

&gt;<i> My main question is, I've noted that <A HREF="http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/">http://www.canonware.com/jemalloc/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't list Solaris as supported by the stand-alone jemalloc
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, which is what I'm using.  A subsequent bullet item lists
</I>&gt;<i> Solaris as being supported by the version of jemalloc that's included in
</I>&gt;<i> Mozilla's FireFox allocator.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is that still the situation today?  I'd really prefer to not try to use

</I>&gt;<i> going forward?  Should I continue on working with stand-alone jemalloc
</I>&gt;<i> on Solaris, or should I investigate using the version in FireFox?
</I>
The stand-alone version of jemalloc is far advanced beyond the version in Mozilla.

If you have general success with jemalloc on Solaris with --disable-tls and you determine that it's the right setting for all Solaris builds, please let me know so that we can force the option, as we do for OS X.  I don't have a Solaris environment set up, so I don't test releases there.  Your email is the first Solaris-related feedback I've received in quite some time, so up to now I've conservatively left it off the list of supported platforms.  There's already Solaris support in the configure script though, and I'm happy to take patches to get/keep jemalloc working on Solaris. 
 
Thanks,
Jason
