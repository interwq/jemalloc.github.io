This difference may be inherent, due to something like size class changes.  Are there any configuration differences between mozjemalloc and jemalloc 3 besides tcache that weren't removed?  In particular, narenas is an important one.

</I>
This looks pretty bad.  The only legitimate potential explanation I can think of is that jemalloc now partitions dirty and clean pages (and jemalloc 3 is much less aggressive than mozjemalloc about purging), so it's possible to have to allocate a new chunk for a large object, even though there would be enough room in an existing chunk if clean and dirty available runs were coalesced.  This increases run fragmentation in general, but it tends to dramatically reduce the number of pages that are dirtied.  I'd like to see the output of malloc_stats_print() for two adjacent points along the x axis, like &quot;After iteration 5&quot; and its predecessor.  I'd also be curious if the VM size increases continue after many grow/shrink cycles (if so, it might be due to an outright bug in jemalloc).

Thanks,
Jason
