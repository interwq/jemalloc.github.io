Note that e.g. a 4 MiB naturally aligned allocation happens to also be naturally aligned at all lesser alignments (2 MiB, 1 MiB, ..., 16 B, etc.), so I don't understand how you're going to make this work unless you prevent e.g. 16 byte allocations from being page-aligned.

</I>
I think you're asking about metadata overhead.  jemalloc stores all metadata separately from allocations, so there are no inherent issues as there would be if allocations had metadata headers.  Also, if you specify --with-lg-size-class-group=0 while configuring the dev version of jemalloc, all size classes will be powers of 2, and all allocations will be naturally aligned.

Regarding worst case fragmentation, the answer depends on size class category and allocation size mixture:

- Small: All 2^n-aligned allocations of size 2^n will incur no additional overhead, due to how small allocations are aligned and packed.

- Large: The worst case size is half the chunk size, in which case only one allocation per chunk can be allocated.  If the remaining (nearly) half of the chunk isn't otherwise useful for smaller allocations, the overhead will essentially be 50%.  However, assuming you use a diverse mixture of size classes, the actual overhead shouldn't be a significant issue in practice.

- Huge: Extra virtual memory is mapped, then the excess is trimmed and unmapped.  This can leave virtual memory holes, but it incurs no physical memory overhead.  Earlier versions of jemalloc heuristically attempted to optimistically map chunks without excess that would need to be trimmed, but it didn't save much system call overhead in practice, and I ripped the code out during a simplification pass.
