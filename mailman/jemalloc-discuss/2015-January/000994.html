<PRE>We adopted the fix for &quot;issue 98&quot; as suggested, and confirmed that it fixes
the problem for our application.

Thank you for the quick analysis and response!

Regards,

Kurt Wampler

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Context:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have an x86_64 Linux C++ application which installs a &quot;NewHandler&quot; that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attempts to cope with an out-of-memory situation [malloc() returns NULL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pointer] in two ways: (1) It performs some amount of garbage collection,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and if this fails to free enough memory, (2) it attempts to raise the soft
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; virtual memory ceiling with a call to setrlimit(RLIMIT_AS,&lt;new_limit&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Expected Behavior:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When jemalloc's malloc() is called from libstdc++'s &quot;new&quot; operator, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mmap() returns a NULL pointer to jemalloc, indicating an out-of-memory
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; condition, jemalloc's malloc() is expected to return a NULL pointer to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its caller, which will in turn trigger our predefined &quot;NewHandler&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Observed Behavior:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We found that jemalloc's malloc() does not immediately return a NULL pointer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after the first failed mmap().  Instead, it returns a series of pointers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it had already given to the application, and only returns a NULL pointer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after the second mmap() fails.  Reassigning already-in-use chunks of memory is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of course deadly, and our application eventually segfaults.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As evidence of this behavior, I'm including an strace logging the two mmap()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calls, the malloc() return values before and after the first failed mmap(),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the subsequent NULL return from malloc() after the second failed mmap(),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; finally triggering the invocation of the &quot;NewHandler&quot;.  Note that address
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0x2aaade7ffa60 is handed out twice, without ever being freed.  The same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is true for addresses 0x2aaade7ffab0, 0x2aaade7ffb00, 0x2aaade7ffb50,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0x2aaade7ffba0, 0x2aaade7ffbf0, 0x2aaade7ffc40, 0x2aaade7ffc9, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 0x2aaade7ffce0 -- all get handed out twice(!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm also including a partial call stack showing the calls from operator
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new() on down, taken at the moment where the first mmap() fails.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Single-stepping in gdb from that point onward, I find that the NULL returned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by mmap() is handed up approximately 10 levels before things go awry.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code seems to re-check in several other places for available memory, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without finding anything it can dole out.  When it has bubbled up to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function je_tcache_alloc_small_hard(), this function calls tcache_alloc_easy().
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In tcache_alloc_easy(), tbin-&gt;ncached is 9, and tbin-&gt;avail[8..0] contains
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 9 addresses mentioned above.  It seems to be erroneously handing them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out again from there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This test case can be reproduced at will within a few minutes of run time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have not yet attempted to devise a fix; it took several days of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; investigation to reach this degree of understanding of the problem.
