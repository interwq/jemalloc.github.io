Welcome to the jemalloc-discuss at canonware.com mailing list.  Most of the 
private correspondence I receive regarding jemalloc is of general 
interest to other jemalloc users, and the volume of such email has 
increased to far more than a trickle, so I want to shift future 
discussions to this publicly archived forum for everyone's benefit. 
Additionally, I think the potential exists for users to interact 
directly here and offer suggestions for real-world tuning, bug 
diagnoses, feature design, etc.

jemalloc continues to be actively developed, so above all I hope that 
the user community can increasingly influence how jemalloc evolves to 
best provide general memory allocation facilities.

Cheers,
Jason
