My experience with such deadlocks has been that either there's a bootstrapping issue due to jemalloc calling some library API that recursively allocates, or the application is trying to allocate inside a signal handler when a signal was raised due to memory corruption.  As far as I know, jemalloc's bootstrapping issues have been worked out, but I've been wrong about that a few times before. =/  In any case, bootstrapping is unlikely to be the issue here, given how far into execution your application has already gotten (assuming the pthread_once() call isn't initiated by jemalloc itself).

Take a look at the gdb output from the following command and make sure you don't see any signs of recursive allocation.

	t apply all bt

If nothing pops out at you, I don't have any other immediate suggestions.  If you find that not all the mutex-related backtraces are the same as pasted above, there may be a deadlock bug in jemalloc that I can't spot from just one backtrace; feel free to send full gdb backtrace output my way if it's non-trivial to interpret.

Thanks,
Jason
