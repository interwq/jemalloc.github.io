Thanks for the feedback.

Right now I am suspecting that something abort()ed within the
application, and there are paths that may dump a (glibc) backtrace()
alongside a backtrace_symbols().  From the manpage and some bugzilla
entries I've read thus far, it seems that backtrace_symbols could be
triggering the deadlock, by allocating memory on its behalf.

From an older ticket we have for tracking this, the backtrace()
hypothesis seems to match the point you've raised about recursive
allocation:

(gdb) thread apply all bt   (most output removed for brevity)

So it would be a matter of making sure a crash-reporting code doesn't
actually cause more harm than good.

Thanks again for your insight into this.  :-)
