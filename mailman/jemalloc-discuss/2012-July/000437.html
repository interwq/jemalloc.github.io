Several years ago jemalloc had this ability, but I removed it because iteration was quite difficult to safely use (no allocation allowed), and the extra data structure overhead didn't seem warranted, given that the functionality was almost never used.

Thanks for the reply. Based on it, I understand that the better
approach for me is to just instrument the user-facing malloc, free,
etc. functions to allocate bigger blocks and store linked list
pointers in the extra allocated space, to maintain a linked list of
blocks. Let me know if for some reason that idea is bad ;-)
