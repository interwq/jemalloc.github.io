jemalloc 3 doesn't maintain the data structures necessary to iterate over live blocks, though it would be possible if arenas kept track of all associated chunks so that the chunks could be iterated over.  Several years ago jemalloc had this ability, but I removed it because iteration was quite difficult to safely use (no allocation allowed), and the extra data structure overhead didn't seem warranted, given that the functionality was almost never used.

Thread caches throw a monkey wrench in things, because from the perspective of arena data structures, cached blocks are allocated.  Therefore, it would be necessary to somehow cancel out the effects of caching, by disabling caching, flushing caches before iteration, or masking the cached blocks during iteration.
