<PRE>Thanks  Konstantin. I think putting jemalloc early enough worked.

But I am getting the following errors and it seems others have seen this error before . I am compiling with windriver toolchain. I ran the configure script, so I am wondering the configure script should have done the right thing and determined that all these definitions are already present and hence when generating the header file , should have skipped these definitions so that this is not an issue.

Do I need to pass specific options to configure or what is the right way to fix this issue ?

&gt;<i> Hi All
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My application worked perfectly with LD_PRELOAD and the virtual memory growth was contained. As soon as I linked it dynamically with jemalloc, this wasn&#8217;t the case. So virtual memory kept growing. So&#160; I am guessing that my application is still not using jemalloc but libc&#8217;s default malloc when linking dynamically. My application is a binary which links to many dynamically loadable libraries some of which are internally built and some are open source versions which we don&#8217;t always build. My questions are:-
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When linking dynamically with jemalloc, is it a requirement to have &#8211;ljemalloc as early as possible or possibly the first library being linked to, to override the default malloc ?
</I>
Yes - this is how dynamic linking works on ELF platforms. When linker sees undefined symbol &quot;malloc&quot; it will take it from first ELF object (in order of specified ld arguments) which has defined &quot;malloc&quot; symbol.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; What method does jemalloc uses while linking to override malloc, does it use the malloc_hooks to override or just the normal linking, so that whatever the linker gets first, it will link to .
</I>
LD_PRELOAD deals only with ELF linking, injecting your library(ies) in the beginning of *.so list used by runtime linked (e.g., ld-linux.so)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Would linking statically&#160; solve this issue, although my preference would be to link dynamically since I have at least 10 processes which needs jemalloc, and at least they would share the code in memory.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; When linking with external open source libraries, do I need to re-compile those with jemalloc as well to make sure any mallocs in those libraries also go through jemalloc or that is not required. I am guessing it should not be required as long as my process links to the right malloc library, their dependencies should be correctly resolved.
</I>
