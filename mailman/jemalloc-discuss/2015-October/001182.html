For optimization purpose we implement a lazy memory de-registration (memory unpinning) policy and we use the hook for the  notification of communication library about memory release event. On the event, we cleanup our registration cache and de-register (unpin) the memory on hardware.

If you already have a mechanism which manages keys, then you can simply install a set of chunk hooks that can perform the registration/deregistration as necessary. We have found this to work quite well for our purposes.

We have allocator choice set up as a configuration-time dependency so it&#8217;s relatively straightforward. 

When the user has selected jemalloc as the allocator (it&#8217;s our default but we have a couple of other options) then a libjemalloc.so that supports the version 4 API is a configure-time requirement. We will just -rpath it into libhpx.so, and/or export it through hpx.pc for libhpx.a.

We have made a decision to distribute all of our default dependencies, so we will actually build a libjemalloc.so from source and install that if we can&#8217;t find one at configuration time. We have made the decision to use it without a prefix, which means it will also be used for local allocation, but it mostly performs better than the libc malloc that&#8217;s installed on the systems that we use so that doesn&#8217;t concern us. A more complicated configuration could support prefixing jemalloc and leaving the local allocation alone.

PS: As an aside, we have [this outstanding issue](<A HREF="https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/203">https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/issues/203</A>) which would be useful to us for key management. Since jemalloc already stores chunk metadata we&#8217;re hoping that we could get 16-64 bytes of &#8220;user&#8221; metadata per chunk so we don&#8217;t need to keep track of our own keys. Hopefully this will become available at some point.
