As a followup, I spent a few days working with the user including
providing them with a version of the library built with no
optimization. &#160;When the hang happens with that version the stacktrace
is very different and appears to be happening trying to obtain the C++
STL's TLS variable that manages exceptions etc. (__cxa_get_global etc.)
and jemalloc is not implicated any longer.

The mutex that is deadlocked appears to be the one taken by the runtime
linker code that loads shared objects. &#160;It's really not clear to me at
all why this code is even being invoked at this point, since we're
definitely not loading objects.

However, armed with this information I suggested to the user that they
force our library to be loaded at startup time of the JVM by using
LD_PRELOAD, and that seems to have solved their problem.

Until I get some way to reproduce the problem myself I don't think it
will be productive for me to work on this further. &#160;However, during
this time I did manage to update our version of jemalloc to 4.2.1,
although it still needs more testing before deploying, so it wasn't all
for nothing! :).

Thanks for the thoughtful suggestions, I do appreciate it.
