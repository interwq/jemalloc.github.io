</I>
Yes; however we also run on Windows where there are similar issues
crossing DLL boundaries even using the default allocator: our code is
careful to never free memory given to us by other libraries and no one
else will free our memory.

We have also compiled jemalloc with -fvisibility=hidden so I don't
think that any other code besides ours will be able to invoke our
jemalloc functions.

I get that this is a fraught area and I'm not 100% sure that our
safeguards are sufficient. &#160;However in all our internal testing things
seem to work OK...

&gt;<i> I huge amount has changed in the TLS-related code since 3.1, so it's
</I>&gt;<i> hard for me to recall the exact quirks relative to the current
</I>&gt;<i> release.&#160;&#160;Trying a newer version is certainly worthwhile.
</I>
I will work on this. &#160;It's not trivial because we've made some changes:
particularly an enhancement to allow us to dump profile stats to a
memory buffer rather than a file, so that we can send them back over
the network to a central admin service.

We have meant to contribute this back although I suspect you would not
be happy with the implementation as it is. &#160;As part of this port I'll
try to clean it up at least a bit and send along a patch, just for
informational purposes if nothing else.

&gt;<i> &gt; Does this seem like it might be plausible?&#160;&#160;If so is there anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that can be done (other than sweeping all my code to remove any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allocation done during a static constructor)?&#160;&#160;It's OK if this is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GCC-only solution, such as using __attribute__((init_priority()))
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or something...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The init_priority attribute could help, but note that there's no
</I>&gt;<i> simple way to guarantee that some other linked code isn't also using
</I>&gt;<i> the maximum priority, thus resulting in arbitrary initialization
</I>&gt;<i> order.
</I>
Yes, I understand. &#160;However looking through all the code for static
content that allocates memory is daunting (as is ensuring more such
content doesn't crop up on the future) so I don't prefer this option,
if it can be avoided.

&gt;<i> &gt; It would be much simpler if I could reproduce the problem myself,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then I could just experiment, but so far no luck.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You may be able to work around this by making jemalloc_constructor()
</I>&gt;<i> visible and calling it directly, i.e. look it up via dlsym() and call
</I>&gt;<i> it immediately after dlopen().&#160;&#160;However, your comments make it sound
</I>&gt;<i> as though this is happening before dlopen() returns.
</I>
Well, the hang definitely happens later, not during dlopen(): it's one
of the earliest operations but it's part of user code after the library
has been loaded. &#160;Of course, if the problem really is initialization of
memory then it could be that the corruption etc. happens during the
dlopen() call and the hang is just a symptom.
